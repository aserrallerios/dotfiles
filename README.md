# My dotfiles!

Decissions, decissions... So what goes in here and what not? I'll try to make an exhaustive list of inclusion criterias. If *something* meets *none* of the criterias I'll have to find a better place for it. Let's go:

* Files that need to be present on the filesystem whenever the shell is running.
* Files that get updated during a typical session and I'd want to replicate in all my workstations.

The idea is to automatically sync this repo (using `sparkleshare` or `gitwatch`), so I won't need to use `Dropbox` anymore for this kind of stuff.
